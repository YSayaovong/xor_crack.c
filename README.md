# XOR Crack

This C program attempts to "crack" ciphertexts that were generated using a Vigen√®re-like cipher. In this case, it uses byte-wise XOR instead of the typical addition modulo 26.

### Features:
- Decrypts XOR-based ciphers.
- Provides a basic introduction to cryptographic cracking techniques.

This project serves as a simple exercise in cryptography and XOR cipher cracking techniques.
